            <h1>About ConnectUs</h1>
            <p>Our job at ConnectUs is to keep everyone safe during this tough time during the coronavirus pandemic. The hospitality industry has been hard hit from closures and the enforcement of gathering track and trace information from everyone. So during the most recent lockdown, I decided to do something to aid this community. I have created a website which resteraunts and pubs can sign up to and people can book tables though us and their track and trace information will be automatically colleceted and stored and in the case of an outbreak, the respective individuals will be contacted.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi my name is Shona Birch. I am 19 years old and have decided that I wanted to aid the hospitality industry in any way that I could. I have seen that the coronavirus pandemic has had a major affect on the hospitality industry and caused a lot of stress on staff. I have had previous experience working as a server so I understand some of the issues and wanted to use my knowledge to help. This is how ConnectUs was created.</p>
